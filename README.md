# Ticker Watcher Visualisation Dashboard

This dashboard serves as a demo to B.Sc. (Business Analytics) Dissertation *Data Mining and Visualisation Framework for
Efficient Cognitive Learning on Financial Market Research.*

In this project, a framework is proposed to speed up market research process and help cognitive learning of overloading information about stock tickers for financial professionals. The framework consists of mainly three components: Text Processing Core, Visualisation Core and Machine Learning Core.


To demonstrate the concept, a dashboard using Python Flask web framework is developed. Various widgets under each core of framework are built. Text Processing Core crawls data from multiple sources and conducts basic pre-processing. Visualisation Core displays stock quotes trend line, word cloud and geospatial widgets. Machine Learning Core summarises relevant news, analyses similar stocks and extracts relevant entities. To evaluate different algorithms and models in summarisation and correlation analysis, multiple experiments are performed and the results are discussed in detail. In addition, Social Components are also added into dashboard to show social mentions and social sentiment score.
